## Description
EventWorld is a web application based on PHP and in particular its Framework Laravel. Through the application, users will be able to be informed about upcoming music events in their area, in their country and in the rest of the world. In addition, after visitors create an account on the website, they will be able to search and save events based on their musical preferences and their favorite artists. The application will use external data to download event information from the Songkick API and will be linked to a separate database for user registration, storage and verification. Finally, an administrator interface will be implemented, to facilitate the management of registered users.
