            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>EventWorld is an online cultural events calendar that focuses on what's on around Greece.
                EventWorld started as an online cultural events calendar that focuses on what's on around Greece because of a lesson in Internation Hellenic University.
                That's why we try to inform people around Greece about the music event will coming up.
                Along the way, with the help of songkick we made a website that help everyone to find music event close to him.
                We want to be the best music event informer site in Greece.<br><br>
                When you log in events are organised into the categories 'Nearest Event', 'Most Popular', 'Athens' and 'Thessaloniki' to help you find what you're looking for.</p>
